-- Hypothesis #1: the revenue of the hotel grows year by year

/* Since the data given for the year 2020 is limited with month August, in order to find out if the revenue
is growing year by year I decided to calculate the revenues of 2018, and 2019 until August, and compare them to the revenue of 2020.*/

with hotels as (
select * from HotelDB..[year2018]
union
select * from HotelDB..[year2019]
union
select * from HotelDB..[year2020])

select arrival_date_year, round(SUM((stays_in_week_nights+stays_in_weekend_nights)*adr),4) as revenue
from hotels
where arrival_date_month not like '%September%' 
and arrival_date_month not like '%October%' 
and arrival_date_month not like '%November%' 
and arrival_date_month not like '%December%'
group by arrival_date_year

/*OUTCOME: Since the revenue of 2018 and 2019 in period of January-August is lower than in same period of 2020, 
and September-December period made up 52.26% and only 36.41% of revenue in 2018 and 2019 accordingly, I can assume that 
the hypothesis is correct, and the revenue is indeed increasing year by year. */

-- Hypothesis #2: the revenue of each hotels grows year by year

with hotels as (
select * from HotelDB..[year2018]
union
select * from HotelDB..[year2019]
union
select * from HotelDB..[year2020])

select hotel, arrival_date_year, round(SUM((stays_in_week_nights+stays_in_weekend_nights)*adr),4) as revenue
from hotels
where arrival_date_month not like '%September%' 
and arrival_date_month not like '%October%' 
and arrival_date_month not like '%November%' 
and arrival_date_month not like '%December%'
group by arrival_date_year, hotel

/*OUTCOME: The revenue of the 'City Hotel' is rapidly growing, while the revenue of 'Resort Hotel' significantly increased in 2019,
but is facing a slight decline in 2020. The actual conclusion on the Resort Hotel's revenue in 2020 could be concluded only with the
missing September-January period.*/
